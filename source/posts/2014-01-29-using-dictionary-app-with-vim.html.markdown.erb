I use Vim for all of my writing.  [This blog](https://github.com/tsaleh/tammersaleh.com), my books, and basically anything longer than a quick email are written in markdown through MacVim.  I find that I'm faster in Vim, which helps me stay focused on producing content.

I also make heavy use of a thesaurus, and I find myself constantly breaking out Dictionary.app.  I have it set to show the thesaurus first, then Wikipedia, and finally the dictionary.  

### Marrying the Two

Vim has some built-in dictionary support, but it can't compete with seeing all of that information at a glance.

It turns out that combining the two is actually incredibly easy due to Vim's keymapping functionality and the fact that OS X's Dictionary.app registers itself as a consumer of `dict://` URIs.  Simply add the following to your `~/.vimrc` file:

~~~ vim
" Use \d on top of a word to look it up in Dictionary.app
nmap <silent> <Leader>d :!open dict://<cword><CR><CR>
~~~

Now, whenever you're curious about finding inventive[^1] ways of stating something - just type `\d` when your cursor is over the word.
