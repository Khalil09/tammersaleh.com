title: Useful MacVim Script
---

A wonderful little script I use on a daily basis is the MacVim shortcut below.

@@@ bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# == 0 ]; then
  mvim
else
  mvim --servername $(basename $(pwd)) \
       --remote-tab-silent "$@" 1>/dev/null 2>&1
fi
@@@

I have this saved as "v":https://github.com/tsaleh/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/v in my @~/bin@ directory, and here's how it works:

@@@
~/code/tsaleh/tammer-saleh$ v Gemfile
# opens Gemfile in a new macvim window
~/code/tsaleh/tammer-saleh$ v config.ru 
# opens config.ru in a tab in that same window
~/code/tsaleh/tammer-saleh$ cd ~/bin
~/bin$ v somefile
# opens somefile in a NEW macvim window
@@@

The magic is in the @pwd@ call, which names the main window the same as your current directory.  The result is a natural flow of tabs being grouped by the project you're working on, and it works really nicely.
