title: Moved to Mephisto
---

Just a quick note to let everyone know that I've moved my blogging engine from Typo to Mephisto.  I also wrote a quick theme inspired by, and totatlly crappy in comparison to Khoi Vinh's "Subtraction":http://subtraction.com/.

I still need to add a few items, like url redirects, project pages, my CV, and a contact page.

You can grab the current version of the theme "here":/assets/theme.tgz.
