title: Campfire API Where Art Thou?
---

So I'm not sure what happened at 37Signals:http://www.37signals.com with their "Campfire":http://www.campfirenow.com application, but both Courenay's "marshmallow":http://www.caboo.se/articles/2006/4/14/meet-marshmallow-the-campfire-bot and Brandon's "Tinder":http://opensoul.org/2006/12/8/tinder-campfire-api seem to be hosed.

When using both of these tools, on pretty much any request, you get a redirect back:

<pre><code>
  Location: http://subdomain.campfirenow.com/
  <html><body>You are being <a href="http://subdomain.campfirenow.com/">redirected</a>.</body></html>
</code></pre>

The campfire API was never set in stone, and that agile development requires the breaking of a few eggs.  That being said, we've got a few products (_cough_ CI _cough_) which really liked being able to integrate with our campfire rooms.

37Signals, DHH, if you're listening:  Please drop us a hint about the new(?) campfire API.

Much appreciated.
