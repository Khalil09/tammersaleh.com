title: ! 'Automatic Fancy Ampersands with jQuery '
---

Back in 2008, Dan Cederholm posted a great design tip on "CSS-based fancy ampersands":http://simplebits.com/notebook/2008/08/14/ampersands-2/. The basics of this technique is that you surround every &amp; in your headers with a @<span class="ampersand">@ tag.  Then, in CSS, you define @.ampersand@ as something like the following:

@@@ css
span.ampersand {
  font-family: Baskerville, Palatino, "Book Antiqua", serif;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: normal;
}
@@@

...or, in "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/:

@@@ sass
.ampersand
  :font-family Baskerville, Palatino, "Book Antiqua", serif
  :font-style italic
  :font-weight normal
@@@

Fancy ampersands are one of those little details that adds a subtle aesthetic touch, and gives the page "an extra notch of professionalism":/hire.  Unfortunately, adding those spans by hand is both bothersome, and error-prone.  It also becomes difficult to make use of this technique for existing or automatically generated content.

h4. Luckily, that's why "god":http://ejohn.org/ created "jQuery":http://jquery.com/!

With a little addition to our @application.js@, we can have fancy ampersands inside all of our header tags (@h1@, @h2@, etc.):

@@@ javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
  $(":header:contains('&')").each(function(){
    $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/&amp;/, "<span class='ampersand'>&amp;</span>"))
  });
});
@@@

You can see this in action on this site, where "blog titles with an ampersand":/posts/my-second-markup-style-meeting get all fancified.
