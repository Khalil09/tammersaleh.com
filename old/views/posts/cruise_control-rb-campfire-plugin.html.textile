title: cruise_control.rb campfire plugin

We've been somewhat unhappy with our current "Cerberus":http://cerberus.rubyforge.org/ installation, so we've decided to jump on the "CC.rb":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/ bandwagon.  Though there were a couple of problems when adding projects (I'll try to expand on that in another post), the overall experience was pretty good -- installation was a breeze, and the plugin system makes extending it dead simple.

As proof... 

h4. Campfire plugin for cruise_control.rb

A builder plugin for "CruiseControl.rb":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com that sends build notices to "campfire":http://www.campfirenow.com/ chat rooms.

h4. Download

You can get the tarball "here":http://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/cruise_control.rb/campfire_notifier.tgz, or grab it from svn at http://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/cruise_control.rb/campfire_notifier.  You can even track it via externals:

<code><pre>
svn propset svn:externals 'campfire_notifier http://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/cruise_control.rb/campfire_notifier' builder_plugins/installed
</pre></code>

h4. Installation

# Create a Campfire account that you will use for sending notifications.
# Copy campfire_notifier_plugin folder to builder_plugins/installed (or use the externals method above)
# Modify builds/your_project/cruise_config.rb by adding the following lines:
    <pre><code>
Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.campfire_notifier.domain   = 'thoughtbot'
  project.campfire_notifier.room     = '38367'
  project.campfire_notifier.ssl      = false
  project.campfire_notifier.username = 'sender@gmail.org'
  project.campfire_notifier.password = 'sender_password'
  ...
end
    </code></pre>
