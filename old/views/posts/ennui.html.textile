I've been going through a creative slump, lately, and I have to say it's getting me down.  Sometimes it just feels like all the other kids in this ever smaller world are getting so much more done with their shooting-star-streak of life.  I've got potential, baby!  ...it's just the spark I worry about. :(

I don't think I'm shootin' too high...  I just want to make an impact on a few (_hundred, thousand_) people out there.  Is that too much to ask in this age of the internet?  Maybe it's the wanting that's getting in the way - producing a drive disingenuous.  Maybe it's all this sitting around, thinking about what I should be doing instead of doing it.  Life certainly does reward those who mold it.  And maybe it's just that I watched the last "ze frank show":http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/03/031607.html this morn', and it's gotten me all sad and nostalgic.

_Sigh_.  Well, I'm open to collaboration.  If anyone out there has a good idea for a site or service to produce, or has mondo graphic/design skillz, and is looking for an Ã¼ber-coder, drop me a line.
