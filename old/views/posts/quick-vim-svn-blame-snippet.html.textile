title: Quick vim svn blame snippet
---

Just to prove the theory that every incredibly incomprehensible piece of code you come across is probably your own, I penned a quick @svn blame@ vim command.

@@@ vim
vmap gl :<C-U>!svn blame <C-R>=expand("%:p") <CR> \| sed -n <C-R>=line("'<") <CR>,<C-R>=line("'>") <CR>p <CR>
@@@

Just "highlight":http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/visual.html the disgusting code in question, and bask in your own shame!
