title: Thread safety in Rails and ActiveRecord
---

This is just a quick post to make this point more accessible to the great oracle that is Google.

If you are using multiple threads (or forking a daemon process) which interact with ActiveRecord, add this line to your code before using the DB connection:

<pre><code class="ruby">
ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency = true
</code></pre>

If you don't, you'll get intermittent errors of the form:

<pre><code>
Mysql::Error: Lost connection to MySQL server during query:
</code></pre>

There.  I've done my part.
