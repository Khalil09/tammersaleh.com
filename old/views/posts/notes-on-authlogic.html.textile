title: Authlogic and FactoryGirl
---

I'm really loving "Authlogic":http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic for user authentication, but at times the magic can be a bit confusing.  One bit that caught me was that creating a new user also logs that user in.  So tests like this:

@@@ ruby
context "a guest user who's not logged in" do
  setup { @guest = Factory(:user) }

  context "on GET to /private" do
    setup { get :private }
    should_be_denied
  end
end
@@@

Totally fail, as the user is automagically logged in behind the scenes.  In the interest of saving another kind developer from hours of hair pulling, the solution lies in the @skip_session_maintenance@ accessor.  By setting this to @true@ in your factory definition, you can convince Authlogic to be a little more predictable:

@@@ ruby
Factory.define :user do |f|
  f.name "Bob"
  # This stops authlogic from logging this new user in.
  f.skip_session_maintenance true
  # ...
end
@@@

Many thanks to "Wilson Bilkovich":http://metaclass.org/ for the answer to this little conundrum.
