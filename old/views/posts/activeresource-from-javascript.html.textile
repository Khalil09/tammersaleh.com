title: ActiveResource from javascript
---

A friend of mine over at "thoughtbot":http://www.thoughtbot.com has just released what I think is one of the coolest things I've seen in ages.   Using "Jester":http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/4/2/jester-javascriptian-rest, you can now access the models of a RESTful rails application through javascript.

<pre><code class="javascript">
>>> eric = User.find(1)
GET http://localhost:3000/users/1.xml
Object _name=User _singular=user _plural=users

>>> eric.posts
[Object _name=Post _singular=post _plural=posts, Object _name=Post _singular=post _plural=posts]

>>> eric.posts.first().body
"Today I passed the bar exam. Tomorrow, I make Nancy my wife."
>>> eric.posts.first().body = "Today I *almost* passed the bar exam. The ring waits one more day."
"Today I *almost* passed the bar exam. The ring waits one more day."

>>> eric.posts.first().save()
POST http://localhost:3000/posts/1.xml
true

>>> post = Post.find(1)
GET http://localhost:3000/posts/1.xml
Object _name=Post _singular=post _plural=posts

>>> post.body
"Today I *almost* passed the bar exam. The ring waits one more day."
>>> post.user
Object _name=User _singular=user _plural=users
>>> post.user.name
"Eric Mill"
</code></pre>
