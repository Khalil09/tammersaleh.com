Mike Clark and the Pragmatic Programmers just released the beta version of their latest offering:  "Advanced Rails Recipes: 72 New Ways to Build Stunning Rails Apps":http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr.  This is one of the few rails books I've been eagerly waiting for, so you can imagine how honored I was when Mike Clark asked me to review his section on Shoulda.  

h4. That's right, folks! Shoulda got its own stake of land in recipe #22:  "Getting Started with BDD."

So head on over and "grab the combo pack":http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr.  You get the beta PDF now ('cause none of us respect delayed gratification) and the print book when it ships - all for around $40.
