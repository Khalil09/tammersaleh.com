Shoulda is a great tool for cleaning up your tests, but there was always some
dirt under the hood that was keeping me up at night.  I don't want to just
"move complexity around":http://www.klankboomklang.com/2007/10/26/class-methods-part-ii-annotations/ - I want to remove it entirely.

A "recent change":http://tammer.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5807/tickets/12-rails-2-0-change-breaks-shoulda in edge rails forced me to get off my butt and do that.

So everyone give a warm hello to the latest "Shoulda gem":http://rubyforge.org/projects/shoulda.  It now uses a Context class in the backend, prints out @should_eventually@ tests in a clear way, names the bare shouldas nicely, and fixes a few small bugs.

I also took the opportunity to fix some of the outstanding issues in the "shoulda rails plugin":http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda (with a lot of great help from the community).

So grab the latest plugin and have some fun:  

@@@ bash
piston install https://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/shoulda/tags/rel-4.0.1 vendor/plugins/shoulda
@@@

Also, "please let me know":http://tammer.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5807-shoulda/tickets if you find any bugs or issues.
