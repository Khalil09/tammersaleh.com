title: Upcoming conferences
---

I'm totally psyched to say that I've been invited to speak at "Scotland on Rails":http://scotlandonrails.com.  I'll be in the company of some "truly amazing ruby developers":http://scotlandonrails.com/speakers, and I highly recommend that you reserve your ticket now.  Who can resist a conference in site of an "ancient scottish stronghold":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle?  Or, more to the point, who can resist the scotch?

I've also been invited to speak at the "Mountain West Ruby conference":http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/ alongside speakers like "Philippe Hanrigou":http://ph7spot.com/ and "Jeremy McAnally (Mr. Neighborly)":http://www.jeremymcanally.com/.  There are a lot of talks at this one that I'm excited about seeing - especially the ones on Datamapper and CouchDB.

So if you're at either of those conferences, then please drop by and say hi.  And, yes, I'm just as fuzzy as my picture in real life.
